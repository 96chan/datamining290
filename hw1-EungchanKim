- What are the types of data available to you?
I extracted meta data of pictures I've taken from my iPhone since I arrived 
in the United States, last August 14th. The meta data included when I took 
pictures, what resolution I used, and even where I took them. 

- For data sets: how many records are in the data set?
It has 1136 records, which means that I've taken 1136 pictures in the 
United States.

- For API: what are the limits on fetching data?
I didn't use API. I used Python Library, which called PIL(Python Image 
Library, http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil). To understand GPS data, I 
should convert the GPS coordinates stored in the EXIF to degrees in float 
format, latitude and longitude. 

- Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is 
interesting.
Record itself doesn't provide interesting insights.
However, if I aggregated those data and sorted them by the day of the week, 
I could get the following records which addressed I had a tendency to take 
more pictures on Friday and Saturday than others. It can be explained that 
I might travel more frequently on those days than other days.

Mon     Tue     Wed	Thu	Fri	Sat	Sun
133	103	130	178	202	235	155


- What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?
1) What time of day did I like to take photos most? 
2) What place or region did I take photos most?  
3) What day of the week did I take photos far from home?
